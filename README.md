# MatPlotLib Challenge
  
# I created a new repository called 'matplotlib-challenge' for this project

# I uploaded the following to my GitHub 'matplotlib-challenge' repository for my submission:

# I uploaded two folders named 'Images' and 'Starter_Code' to the 'matplotlib-challenge' repository

# The 'Starter-Code' folder contains a 'Pymaceuticals' folder which contains the jupyter notebook 'pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb' which has the code to run

# My written analysis can be found at the top of the jupyter notebook 'pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb'.
 
 # I uploaded this README.md file to accompany my submission
 
 # I created this shareable link to my repository <https://github.com/jdelacruzjr/matplotlib-challenge.git> and submitted that to to <https://bootcampspot-v2.com>
